# Major Projects

This repository contains my **major academic and personal projects** developed during my **B.Sc. Computer Science** journey.

Each project is organized in a **separate folder** with its own structure, dependencies, and implementation logic.  
The focus of this repository is on **real-world application development, clean code organization, and full-stack fundamentals**.
